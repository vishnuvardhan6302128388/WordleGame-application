> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts you’ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
